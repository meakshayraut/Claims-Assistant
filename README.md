# Recoverly - Insurance Claim Assistant

 A web application built to make insurance claims **less painful and more structured** after property damage. When someone loses items due to disasters, theft, or accidents, the hardest part is usually gathering proof, building an inventory, and keeping documents in one place. Recoverly brings all of that into a single system **item lists, receipts, photos, reports, and collaboration with adjusters** so claims can be created and managed faster.
